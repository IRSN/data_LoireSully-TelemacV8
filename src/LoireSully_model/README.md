This directory holds the Loire-Sully model.

For now, some files are missing (see .gitignore file):

* "user_fortran/" subdir holds the user fortran files
* "courbe_tarage_NEW.txt"
* "BC_Loire_V2n1.cli"
* all "*.slf" files, replaced by their "_md5" signature (for checking)

Theses files may be available on request.
